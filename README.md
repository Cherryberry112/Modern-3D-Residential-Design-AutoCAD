# 🏘️ 3D Architectural Building Design

A comprehensive architectural project featuring a full-scale 3D building model and 2D engineering layouts. This project was developed as part of the **Computer Aided Engineering Drawing (CSE-200)** curriculum to demonstrate advanced spatial modeling and structural design.

###  Project Features

* **Full 3D Modeling**: A complete 3D perspective of the building, showing structural depth and exterior design.
* **Precision Floor Plans**: Detailed 2D blueprints focusing on wall thickness, room dimensions, and functional flow.
* **Engineering Standards**: All drawings are scaled and labeled according to modern civil and computer-aided design principles.

### 📂 File Guide

* **`project.dwg`**: The primary AutoCAD source file. Includes both the 2D "Floor and Wall Plan" and the 3D "building" layers.
* **`Project.pdf`**: A very simple report of the previews 

###  Technical Details

* **Software**: AutoCAD 2024
* **Course**: CSE-200 (Fall 2024)
* **Design Type**: Residential / Multi-room Building

###  Viewing Instructions

To explore the 3D model, open the `.dwg` file in AutoCAD and use the **3D Orbit** tool to rotate the building. For a quick look at the results, refer to the PDF documentation.
